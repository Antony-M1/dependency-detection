Certainly! Here's a concise paragraph summarizing the difference and relationship:

# Summary
The **`google-auth`** library is responsible solely for **authentication and credential management**. It handles **OAuth 2.0**, **service accounts**, and **access tokens** for securely accessing Google APIs. On the other hand, **`google-api-python-client`** is used to **interact with Google services** like Drive, Gmail, and Sheets by making **actual API calls**. While `google-api-python-client` provides the interface to communicate with Google APIs, it **does not handle authentication on its own** â€” it requires credentials from a library like `google-auth`. Therefore, to securely use `google-api-python-client`, you typically **need `google-auth`** to authenticate requests. In short: **`google-auth` provides credentials**, and **`google-api-python-client` uses them to call APIs**.
